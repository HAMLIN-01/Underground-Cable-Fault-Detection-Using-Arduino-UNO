# Underground-Cable-Fault-Detection-Using-Arduino-UNO
This project demonstrates an underground cable fault detection system using an Arduino. It helps identify the location of a fault in a cable by measuring voltage variations across different segments. The code is written in Embedded C using Arduino IDE, and the simulation is done in Proteus.
# Functionality:
The system uses an Arduino microcontroller to measure the voltage across different sections of an underground cable. If a fault occurs in any section, there will be a significant change in the voltage, which the Arduino detects. The system displays the fault location on an LCD, making it easier for the operator to identify the affected area.
# Tools:
The project is implemented using an Arduino microcontroller and programmed in Embedded C through the Arduino IDE. The simulation of the system is done in Proteus, which allows for virtual testing and debugging before physical implementation. The system uses simple resistors to simulate the cable sections in the simulation.

In summary, the abstract highlights the purpose of the project (detecting underground cable faults), how it works (using voltage measurement and LCD display), and the tools used to implement and simulate the system (Arduino, Embedded C, Arduino IDE, and Proteus).
