# Underground-Cable-Fault-Detection-Using-Arduino-UNO
This project demonstrates an underground cable fault detection system using an Arduino. It helps identify the location of a fault in a cable by measuring voltage variations across different segments. The code is written in Embedded C using Arduino IDE, and the simulation is done in Proteus.
